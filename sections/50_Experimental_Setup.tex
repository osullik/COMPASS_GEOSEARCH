\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{section:experimental_setup}


\par{
    We design our experiments to balance the power-law distribution of real-world object placement with the cleanliness required for robust experimental evaluation. 
    We provide a data generator that produces a replicable benchmark dataset.
    We generate objects using a power-law distribution and generate query terms from a disjoint set of labels from those objects, enabling precision and recall measurements.
    When generating queries, the data generator simulates real-world user variance and error by introducing the following distortions:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textit{Translation}, which shifts the query objects in $x$ and $y$, to simulate lack of user knowledge about where in the region objects lie.
        \item \textit{Dilation}, which expands the query from its centroid to simulate lack of user knowledge about the distance between objects.
        \item \textit{Rotation}, which spins the query about its centroid to simulate a query that is misaligned with the global coordinate systems.
    \end{enumerate}
    }
\par{
    We generate two benchmark datasets, one with the aforementioned distortions (\textit{Distorted}) and one without (\textit{Normal}). 
    In both datasets, we vary the number of objects in the database and in the query, which allows for empirical measurements of search performance across different spatial search methods.
