\section{COMPASS Data Structures}
\label{section:data_structures}
To enable spatial search without relying on costly graph representations, \emph{COMPASS} encodes spatial entities using Location-Object data structures and Object-Object Concept Map data structures. 
All our data structures are implemented hierarchically. \textit{Objects} are the atomic elements. They are semantically grouped into \textit{Locations}, which are grouped into \textit{Regions}, which are our division of the world. For example, the `Washington DC' region might have `park' and `hospital' locations, and the `park' might have `swing', `slide', and `bench' objects, with directional relations defined between them. 

\subsection{Location-Object Data Structure}
An \textit{Location-Object Data Structure} is a per-location set-based representation of the directional relations between objects and their locations.
It subdivides the space around a location into the four cardinal quadrants (NorthWest, NorthEast, SouthWest, SouthEast) centered on the location coordinate.

Each location-object relationship is encoded independently of other objects at that location.
Figure \ref{figure:ConceptMap-LO} shows how we encode objects (\ref{fig:CM-LO-Example}) based on their relative position to the location coordinates (\ref{fig:CM-LO-Setup}).


\subsection{Object-Object Concept Map Data Structure}

A \textit{concept map} (CM) is an $nxn$ matrix representation that implicitly encodes the $m$ directional relations between $n$ stored objects, similar to the intuition behind the concept map representations of images~\cite{Xu2010}.
Matrix entries are either $0$, representing empty space, or an object ID, representing the relative position of that object to the $n-1$ other objects.
Using Algorithm~\ref{alg:geoToGrid}, we assign each object to a position $(i,j)$ in the matrix where $i$ is its order of appearance from north to south and $j$ is the same object's order of appearance from west to east.
This method preserves the relative ordering of objects from north to south and west to east for the original Cartesian representation.
Figure \ref{figure:ConceptMap} shows how a set of objects (\ref{fig:CM-Example}) are encoded in a concept map (\ref{fig:CM-OO-Setup}), preserving their directional relations.

%This data structure subdivides the space around a location into segments or buckets, retaining a discrete set of directional relations, determined by the number of buckets.
%We choose to divide the space into four quadrants based on global cardinal direction with respect to the location- NorthWest, NorthEast, SouthWest, and SouthEast.
