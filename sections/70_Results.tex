\subsection{Algorithm Analysis}

Our \textbf{locationObjectSearch} implementation searches each quadrant of the candidate location for matching objects that were specified in the query, resulting in a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(Q + O)$ for $Q$ query points and $O$ objects per location. 
Since the number of query points is typically much smaller than the number of objects per location, we expect to see $\mathcal{O}(O)$ time complexity in most scenarios.

Our \textbf{objectObjectSearch} implementation traverses a matrix of size $\# Objs \times \# Objs$ from North and West, slicing the matrix smaller and smaller as it traverses. 
Since no part of the matrix is looked at more than once, this results in a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(Q + O^2)$ for $Q$ query points and $O$ objects per location. 
This reduces to $\mathcal{O}(O^2)$ when $Q \ll O$. %Since the number of query points is typically much smaller than the number of objects per location, we expect to see $\mathcal{O}(O^2)$ time complexity in most scenarios.

Our \textbf{cardinalityInvariantObjectObjectSearch} implementation performs \textbf{objectObjectSearch} $3Q$ times, resulting in a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(Q^2 + Q\times O^2)$ for $Q$ query points and $O$ objects per location, which reduces to $\mathcal{O}(O^2)$ when $Q \ll O$.
