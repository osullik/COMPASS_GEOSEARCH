The \textit{Spatial Pattern Matching} paradigm offers a promising direction for searching with incomplete or imperfect information, but it is badly constrained by dependence on graph-based representations and computationally intensive search algorithms. 
We present \emph{COMPASS} as a reframing of the spatial pattern matching problem. 
We group geospatial objects into semantic \textit{locations} and replace graph structures with an abstracted matrix \textit{competency map} representation of each location. 
The abstracted view permits encoding of the directional relationships that are usually too dense for representation using graph-based methods. We search using our \textit{Cardinality Invariant Object-Object Grid Search} algorithm, which finds matches even when the query is not aligned to a global coordinate system, resulting in perfect recall across distorted query sets in our evaluation. 
Our analysis shows that while the theoretical complexity of that our algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(GQ^2 + Q\times n^2)$ 
%for $Q$ query points and $n$ objects for each of $G$ locations 
in the worst case, the empirical performance is closer to logarithmic growth on the number of query terms.
\emph{COMPASS} is a suite of data structures and algorithms that enable pattern-based search using directional relation constraints and offers a viable alternative to the dominant set-intersection, subgraph matching, and constraint satisfaction approaches.


%Effective spatial search typically requires users to know the exact coordinates or name of the location they seek.
%When only partial or imperfect information is available, distance-based nearest-neighbor searching can be used.
%However, distance-based approaches require users to estimate the distance between objects in the environment, a task that humans perform poorly.
%The more natural spatial search alternative is pictorial querying, where a sketch map enables users to place objects in a configuration where their relative positions define the query constraints.
%Most approaches to pictorial query searching are intractable for any realistic number of query and database terms.
%We present \emph{COMPASS}, a collection of data structures and algorithms that address geospatial search as a human-centric rather than a map-centric task. 
%The \emph{COMPASS} suite addresses scalability issues that previously rendered pictorial-based searching infeasible. 
%Of our three search methods, our Cardinality-Invariant Object-Object search achieves perfect recall in testing, an improvement of 0.9 on non-invariant approaches with a worst-case complexity of $\mathcal{O}(Q^2 + Q\times n^2)$.

%Humans spend a lot of time searching for things. 
%With the advent of tools like google maps and open street maps, people can search through geospatial data at a whim. 
%These tools focus on providing exact matches to queries or a list of candidate locations based on the user's query. 
%Frequently, searchers only have access to partial information. 
%Whether it has been a long time since visiting a location, they have a vague recommendation from a friend or are an investigator trying to identify a location to solve a crime- a common problem is how to find a location of interest based on partial information. 
%This project designs \textit{the \textbf{G}eospatially \textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{S}earch with \textbf{T}errain \textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{L}ocation \textbf{T}argeting (\textbf{GESTALT})}, and implements a proof-of-concept of the proposed architecture. 
%Based on a new best-case dataset developed for this project, \textit{The Swan Valley Wineries dataset}, demonstrates the functionality and utility of \textit{GESTALT} while identifying substantial opportunities for future work. 


%Geographic information systems (GIS) provide users with a means to efficiently search over spatial data given certain key pieces of information, like the coordinates or exact name of a location of interest. 


%However, current GIS capabilities do not enable users to easily search for locations about which they have imperfect or incomplete information.
